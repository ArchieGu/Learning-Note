# Serverless

[Serverless compute](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/serverless/) can be thought of as a function as a service (FaaS), or a microservice that is hosted on a cloud platform. Your business logic runs as functions and you don't have to manually provision or scale infrastructure.

## Benefits of a serverless compute solution

### Avoids over-allocation of infrastructure

### Stateless logic

### Event driven

### Functions can be used in traditional compute environments

## Drawbacks of a serverless compute solution

### Execution time

### Execution frequency
